## GamePlay
This is an adventurous game where you collect diamonds. You must gather 7 gems, and the game is divided into two levels. In the first level, there are 4 gems. You must collect all 4 gems to activate the teleportation portal to the second level. Along the way, you must evade enemy attacks and acquire gems—be cautious! The journey is perilous, and falling off cliffs will lead to instant death!

The second level features 3 gems. You can obtain two of them through exploration, while the third gem is guarded by three angelic guardians. Once you collect 6 gems, they will challenge you. Upon completing their trial, they will reward you with the final gem!

## Health Points System
Our product features an excellent health points system, with each one accompanied by animated effects.

Moreover, you have the freedom to control the length of the health points at your discretion.

The health points system is divided into three parts: the head, tail, and middle. 

Head Part:

<br>1.1 Idle</br>
<br>1.2 Death</br>
<br>1.3 Healing</br>
<br>1.4 Taking Damage</br>

<br>Tail Part:</br>

<br>2.1 Idle</br>
<br>2.2 Death</br>
<br>2.3 Healing with Blood</br>
<br>2.4 Healing without Blood</br>
<br>2.5 Taking Damage with Blood</br>
<br>2.6 Taking Damage without Blood</br>

<br>Middle Part:</br>

<br>3.1 Idle</br>
<br>3.2 Death</br>
<br>3.3 Healing with Blood</br>
<br>3.4 Healing without Blood</br>
<br>3.5 Currently Healing</br>
<br>3.6 Taking Damage with Blood</br>
<br>3.7 Taking Damage without Blood</br>
<br>3.8 Currently Taking Damage</br>

(All animated effects were conceptualized by [@Linjiajie2002](https://github.com/Linjiajie2002) and crafted using Aseprite. I referenced and utilized the following resource: https://otsoga.itch.io/dynamic-status-bars.)


## Trials of the Angels
In the Trials of the Angels, you must navigate through intense enemy attacks while collecting three types of energy orbs. For each type of energy orb, you need to collect them five times.

Occasionally, there will also be opportunities to treat (heal) blood packs, and being prepared is how you can encounter them.

Upon successful completion of the task, you will be entitled to receive a reward, thereby acknowledging your efforts and achievements in the process.
